GetOffTheToilet
===============

Helping people reduce wasted time spent on phone while sitting on the toilet

Issue:

People spend too much time on the toilet not actually moving their bowels and instead wasting time reading and playing on their phone. GetOffTheToilet solves this issue by limiting the amount of time people waste in the john after taking care of business.

Current Progress:
We have so far created a basic 1 activity android app. Currently, it only includes a countdown timer. 

Follow our progress here as we hope to help you stop wasting time in the bathroom. 

If you have any feedback or suggesstions, feel free to reach us at azpoliak@gmail.com
